# LibLab Take-Home Project - Frontend - Henry

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Setup

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies: `yarn install`.
2. Start the development server: `yarn start`. This will run the app in development mode and open it in your browser
   at http://localhost:3000.
3. Make edits to the code, and the page will automatically reload with the changes. Any lint errors will be displayed in
   the console.

## Testing

To run the unit tests, use the command: `yarn test`. This will launch the test runner in interactive watch mode.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production, execute: `yarn build`. This will create a production-optimized build in the build
folder. The build is minified and ready for deployment.
